About: This is a simple project that answer 200 if a word is palindrome or 400 if it's not


Steps:
  1. Assure that you have node.js
  2. Execute node server using node app.js  
  3. http://localhost:3000/:word where :word can be any text
  4. The server will response OK if it's a palindrome or Bad Request if isn't.

Delays:
 I had a problem using Angular with Express.js and unfortunately I couldn't finish the frontend in time. So it's only possible to use the server at the moment.
  
Thanks.
